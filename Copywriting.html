      For this assignment I was required to make a single page ad for a brand I selected. I choose Bali Body because I used to wear their fake tan all the time.  I firsly did some research <br>
    about the company and what types of products they offer. I then needed to find out the demographics for the brand and come up with a psychographic to match. Once I did that <br>
    I needed to research who their competitors were and do a review of the Bali Body social media channels. I then put together the ad using information I had gathered. I created the <br>
    ad at home using a Bali Body product I already had. I wanted the image to have bright and fun colours to catch the attention of the target market. The message that I wanted to create <br>
    was that if you use this tan you will feel confident and that will then transfer into feeling good and having a positive mindset.
